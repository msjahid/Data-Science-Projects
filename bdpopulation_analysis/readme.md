# City Perspectives: Bangladeshi Urban Data

ðŸŒ† This project offers an in-depth look at urban data for cities across Bangladesh. By analyzing various attributes such as population trends, geographical area, and administrative divisions, the project aims to provide valuable insights into urban development and demographic changes over time.

## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of cities in Bangladesh, examining various attributes including population statistics over different years, geographical area, and administrative divisions. The goal is to uncover trends and insights related to urbanization, demographic shifts, and regional development.

## Dataset Description

The dataset comprises 64 rows and 10 columns, each representing different attributes related to Bangladeshi cities. The columns in the dataset are:

1. **Name**: The official name of the city as recognized by administrative authorities.
2. **Abbr.**: The abbreviation or short form of the city name, often used for convenience or in informal contexts.
3. **Division**: The administrative division to which the city belongs.
4. **Established**: The year the city was established or its administrative status was assigned.
5. **Native**: The native or local name of the city, which may differ from the official name.
6. **Area (km2)**: The total land area of the city in square kilometers.
7. **Population_1991**: The population of the city as recorded in 1991.
8. **Population_2001**: The population of the city as recorded in 2001.
9. **Population_2011**: The population of the city as recorded in 2011.
10. **Population_2022**: The population of the city as recorded in 2022.

### Data Quality

- **Missing Values**: The dataset contains no missing values.
- **Duplicates**: The dataset contains no duplicate values.
- **RangeIndex**: The dataset includes 64 entries.
- **Data Types**: The dataset consists of 6 integer columns and 4 object columns.

## Analysis

The analysis will focus on:

1. **Population Trends**: Examining population changes over time from 1991 to 2022 for each city.
2. **Geographical Analysis**: Analyzing the relationship between the area of cities and their population growth.
3. **Regional Distribution**: Exploring population distribution across different administrative divisions.
4. **Urbanization Trends**: Understanding urbanization patterns and their impact on city development.
