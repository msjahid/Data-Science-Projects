# College Student AI Use in School

## Introduction

This project investigates the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) among college students, focusing on their knowledge, usage frequency, and interest in AI-related careers. The dataset, titled "College Student AI Use in School," contains responses from 255 students across different disciplines, providing a comprehensive view of how AI is perceived and utilized in an educational context.

## Dataset Description

The dataset comprises 255 rows and 7 columns, capturing various aspects of AI use among students. Each row represents an individual student's response, recorded with a precise timestamp. The columns in the dataset are as follows:

1. **response_timestamp**: The exact date and time when the student responded to the survey.
2. **ai_knowledge_rating**: A self-assessed rating of the student's knowledge about AI on a scale from 0 to 5.
3. **ai_personal_use_frequency**: The frequency with which the student uses AI in their personal life, rated on a scale from 0 to 5.
4. **ai_school_use_frequency**: The frequency with which the student uses AI for school-related activities, rated on a scale from 0 to 5.
5. **interest_in_ai_career**: The student's interest in pursuing a career in AI, rated on a scale from 0 to 5.
6. **awareness_of_chat-gpt**: A binary indicator (0 or 1) of whether the student is aware of ChatGPT, an advanced AI language model.
7. **college**: The academic discipline of the student, categorized into "Science, Engineering, & Technology," "Business," and "Humanities & Social Sciences."

## Data Quality

The dataset is clean, containing no duplicate values or missing data. This ensures the reliability and accuracy of any analyses performed.

### Data Summary

- **Total Rows**: 255
- **Total Columns**: 7
- **Duplicate Values**: 0
- **Missing Values**: 0

## Significance

Understanding how AI is integrated into the daily lives and academic pursuits of college students can provide valuable insights for educators, policymakers, and tech developers. It can help identify gaps in knowledge, usage patterns, and potential interest in AI careers, ultimately contributing to more targeted and effective educational programs and tools.

## Analysis

The analysis will focus on:

1. **AI Knowledge and Usage**: Exploring the levels of AI knowledge and how frequently students use AI in both personal and school contexts.
2. **Career Interests**: Investigating students' interest in AI-related careers.
3. **Awareness of ChatGPT**: Examining the awareness levels of ChatGPT among students from different disciplines.
4. **Discipline-based Insights**: Comparing responses across different academic disciplines to identify unique trends and patterns.
