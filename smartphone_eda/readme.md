16. **Screen Size**: The size of the smartphone screen, typically measured diagonally in inches.
17. **Refresh Rate**: The screen refresh rate, usually measured in Hertz (Hz).
18. **Num Rear Cameras**: The number of rear cameras on the smartphone.
19. **Num Front Cameras**: The number of front cameras on the smartphone.
20. **OS**: The operating system of the smartphone.
21. **Primary Camera Rear**: The resolution of the primary rear camera.
22. **Primary Camera Front**: The resolution of the primary front camera.
23. **Extended Memory Available**: Indicates whether the smartphone supports extended memory.
24. **Extended Upto**: The maximum capacity of extended memory supported, usually measured in gigabytes (GB).
25. **Resolution Width**: The width of the screen resolution.
26. **Resolution Height**: The height of the screen resolution.

## Data Quality

The dataset is mostly clean but contains some missing values in certain columns. Below is a summary of the missing values:

- **Rating**: 101 missing values
- **Processor Brand**: 20 missing values
- **Num Cores**: 6 missing values
- **Processor Speed**: 42 missing values
